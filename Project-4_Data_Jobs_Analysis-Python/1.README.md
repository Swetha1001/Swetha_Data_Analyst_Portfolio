# Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

## Import & Clean Up Data

```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])

🏠 Only 8.9% of data job postings are remote, indicating that fully remote roles remain relatively limited.

🏢 A large majority — 91.1% of postings — are not remote, suggesting that most companies still prefer on-site or hybrid arrangements for data positions.

💡 This highlights that while remote data jobs exist, they represent a small fraction of the overall market, making location flexibility less common in the data domain.

📊 Organizations may still value in-person collaboration, access to secure systems, or team-based workflows in data projects.


## 5. Which locations have the highest number of job postings?

The visualization highlights the top locations with the highest number of data-related job postings.
It provides insights into where demand for data professionals is concentrated globally.

#### Result:

![Locations with highest numbers](Result/5.Locations_with_highest_number_of_job_postings.png)  

#### Key Insights:

📍 Anywhere (Remote) accounts for the largest number of postings, showing strong flexibility for some roles.

🌏 Singapore follows , reflecting a growing hub for data analytics and tech jobs in Asia.

📍 Paris, France is also among the top locations, highlighting Europe’s contribution to the global data job market.

🌏 Bengaluru, Karnataka, India and London, UK come next, indicating strong hiring activity in both Asian and European tech centers.

💼 These trends show that while remote opportunities exist, major global cities remain key hubs for data professionals, offering diverse opportunities across analytics, engineering, and data science.

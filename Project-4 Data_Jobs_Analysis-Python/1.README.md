```python
# filter data to only include salary values from India

df_US = df[(df['job_country'] == 'United States')].dropna(subset=['salary_year_avg'])
```

```python
job_titles = df_US['job_title_short'].value_counts().index[:6].tolist()

# filter the df for the top 6 job titles
df_US_top6 = df_US[df_US['job_title_short'].isin(job_titles)]

# order the job titles by median salary
job_order = df_US_top6.groupby('job_title_short')['salary_year_avg'].median().sort_values(ascending=False).index

job_titles
```
```python
#Plot the top 6 job titles salary distributions using a box plot.

sns.boxplot(data=df_US_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order=job_order)
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.despine()

plt.title('Salary Distributions of Data Jobs in the US')
plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary (USD)')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.xlim(0, 600000)
